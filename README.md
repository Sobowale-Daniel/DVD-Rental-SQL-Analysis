# DVD-Rental-SQL-Analysis
## Introduction
This project explores a DVD rental database using SQL to answer key business questions. It's a practical demonstration of how structured query language can be applied to extract meaningful insights from a relational database. This dataset simulates a DVD rental store's operations and customer interactions.
## Project Objectives
The purpose of this project is to:
- Practice and showcase SQL skills.
- Answer real-world business questions using SQL queries.
- Work with common SQL operations such as joins, grouping, sorting, and filtering.
## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL (or any SQL-based RDBMS)
- DVD Rental sample database
## Business Questions Answered
Below are the questions answered with SQL in this project:
- Who are the customers that have made at least one rental?
- What is the title of the film and the name of the customer who rented it?
- List all customers, including those who have never rented anything.
- List all films and show rental date if rented, else return NULL.
- Match all customers and all rentals (including unmatched records).
- Show all film titles and rental dates, whether they were rented or not.
- List all customer names.
- List all film titles with their release years.
- Who are the customers that live in the city of Aurora?
- Which films have a rental duration longer than 5 days?
- List staff names and their store addresses.
- List films with their language names.
- What are the 10 most rented films and their rental counts?
- Which customers rented the most films?
- Which cities have more than 10 customers?
- Which film titles were rented more than 50 times?
## ER Diagram
This ER diagram provides a visual overview of the relationships between the tables in the DVD Rental database. It helps to understand how entities such as customers, rentals, films, inventory, and staff are related.
## What I Learned
- How to use different types of joins effectively (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).
- How to aggregate data with GROUP BY and use HAVING to filter groups.
- Writing readable and practical SQL for real-world scenarios.
